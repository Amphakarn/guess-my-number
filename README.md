# Guess My Number Game

A one-player game built using Javascript, HTML and CSS.

Each round, the game generates a secret random number between 1 and 20. A player starts with a score of 20 points. The Player has to guess the secret number and if the guessing number matches the secret number, the player wins. The point gets deducted every time a player guesses a wrong number. The game is over when the score reaches zero. A player can start a new game by pressing the 'Again!' button.
